# How I Track my Time

Since Spring of 2023, I have tracked my out-of-class time (i.e. everything except lectures) spent for each course I've taken. All of this was done through [Toggl](https://track.toggl.com/timer), which is free and intuitive. Each course was designated as its own project, and each assignment was tracked individually. 

In Fall of 2023, I added tags that specified the type of work being done for a specific assignment.

* **Writing**: Any type of writing done that was not note-taking. This includes essays, discussions, reports, and short answers.
  * Any technical reports or analyses on code that I created are considered a type of writing. 
* **Coding**: Any type of coding that is not a simple configuration task (like setting up an IDE).
* **Practice**: Any non-coding and non-note-taking work that increased my understanding of the material. This could also be considered Studying. 
  * All homework worksheets are considered a type of practice.
  * Any type of studying, including reviewing my notes, is a type of practice.
  * This category is intentionally broad and serves as a catch-all for ambiguous work. 
* **Reading**: Any note-taking activity. This includes watching videos and reading lessons.
* **Research**: Any type of open-ended, exploratory research.
  * This includes literature reviews,
  * This is not the same as reading. From my perspective, reading distills content without the creation of new ideas, while research synthesizes topics and creates something new.
* **Implementing**: Any configuration task that does not require specific skills.
  * This includes IDE configuration, LMS configuration, etc.
* **Assessments**: Any assessment taken outside of class. This includes quizzes and exams.

I do not track lecture time. I attend (nearly) every lecture, so I can easily calculate how much time I've spent in lecture if needed. Furthermore, the benchmark of "3 hours per 1 hour of lecture" was a compelling relationship to explore (and, for me, it's untrue). 

I have a few rules for when I track time: 
* Looking at my phone for more than 15 seconds forces the timer to stop.
* Any breaks (bathroom, snack, stretch) forces the timer to stop.
* Switching tasks forces the timer to switch with me.

# Why I Track my Time

There's a few reasons why I track the time I spend on classes: 

### 1. Tracking assignments early in the semester helps me project my workload for later in the semester. 
> Generally, if assignments are well-formatted and well-balanced, the time spent on subsequent assignments of the same type in a class will decrease throughout the semester. This is not always the case, but it at least provides a benchmark. Using historical data allows me to calculate burndown rates as finals approach and helps me manage final projects. 
### 2. Tracking time allows me to compare relative difficulty between classes and between assignments
> If an asignment is taking longer than I would expect, it forces me to analyze how I could more effectively be using time. Perhaps this is taking a break if I haven't made progress in the last 30 minutes. Or, perhaps this means I need to change how I'm using my time. Furthermore, if a class is taking a signficiantly longer amount of time than other classes, that's a cause for concern. 
### 3. Tracking classes keeps me (and professors) accountable
> One of my biggest pet peeves is hearing other students say, "I spent ALL day working on this assignment." Really? ALL day? Complaints towards class time commitments can be hyperbolic and can force unncessary concessions from professors and creates a negative student culture. Tracking my own time allows me to (a) recognize inordinate time use on an assignment and change my strategy or (b) approach the professor with concerns about my time commitments. In the latter case, I have data to support my feeling that an assignment is taking a relatively large amount of time despite my best efforts to control the commitment. In the rare cases this has happened, the professor or TA can help me identify where I'm spending too much time.
### 4. Tracking my time keeps me focused
> Starting a timer means that I am engaging in deep work. There's a mindset shift when that timer starts. It prevents me from getting distracted or otherwise increasing the amount of time I spend on an assignment. 

# Why I'm Releasing this Data

When I'm registering for classes and preparing for a semester, I usually have 2 questions about a class: 
1. Will this be interesting?
2. How much time will this take?

Furthermore, when I start an assignment, I have two similar questions:
1. How much will I learn from this?
2. How much time will this take? 

I've decided to release my time-tracking because I believe that it's helpful for: 
* Students at my school: seeing the overall time spent on a class is generally beneficial for course registration. However, it would also be useful to see individual assignment breakdowns. While it's always the hope that previous assignments in a class will project the time commitment for subsequent assignments, there's significant variability. I know **I** would personally appreciate seeing how long it took for other students to complete these assignments.
* Students at other schools: there's a pervasive hustle culture that glorifies the usage of time. Spending time on something you hate is entertaining, but certainly not encouraging. I'm hoping that this demonstrates that academic success is possible without being miserable. 
* Faculty: It's easy for students to overexaggerate their time usage, especially if it's for a class they didn't enjoy. Being able to see how a student spends their time outside of class may be beneficial to course planning and content management.

# About Me

I am a Junior at the Colorado School of Mines studying Computer Science with a minor in Public Affairs. I've maintained a 4.0 in all of my coursework, so this time tracking data is indicative of what it took me to get an A in a class. This will not be the same for everybody.
